### Operators in TypeScript

Tutorial

Operators are used for arithmetic operations, comparisons, and logical evaluations.

    let result: number = 10 * 2;  // 20

Exercise
-------
Declare two variables: `x` initialized to 5 and `y` initialized to 7. Create a third variable `z` that stores the result of `(x + y) * 3`.

Tutorial Code
-------
    let x: number = 5;
    let y: number = 7;

Expected Output
-------
    36

Solution
-------
    let z: number = (x + y) * 3;
